"I only want the paragraph translated without doing anything else. I desire a beautiful and attractive website with a nice moving background that is consistent with the companies working to serve customers. The idea of the website is to book a break/rest period (break time) that any employee is entitled to, but I have strict rules to ensure there is no unfairness and that it is fair to them. The idea aligns with the nature of the work shift. The shift is 8 hours, and each employee has one hour of break time, but it is divided according to this strict breakdown:

First condition: There is no break allowed in the first hour of the shift's start. This means if the employee comes to work and starts at 8:00 AM, they will not take a break until the beginning of 9:00 AM. This also applies to the end of the shift; they will not take a break in the last hour. So, if their shift ends at 4:00 PM, the last time the employee can stop for a break is 2:59 PM.

Second condition: The break must be taken in the following three segments: the first break is 15 minutes, the second will be 30 minutes, and the third will be 15 minutes. There must be a gap of two hours between the first and second break, two and a half hours between the second and third break, and four and a half hours between the first and third break.

Third condition: The employee will not be able to take the second break first. This condition will be strict, where taking the first break (15 minutes) is mandatory. The 30-minute break will appear 'blurred' (or disabled/greyed out). If the employee selects the first break (15 minutes), the half-hour break becomes available (un-blurs), and the 15-minute break becomes 'blurred' (disabled) for them. If the employee selects the 30-minute break, the 30-minute break closes and becomes 'blurred' (disabled) for them, and the 15-minute break opens immediately afterward. After this, the employee enters their name and department and presses 'Confirm.' This then appears in their break schedule with a timer/counter that tracks the start and end of each break. For example, it shows when the first break will start, and if it has started, when it will end, and if it has ended, it shows 'Finished.'

The employees' breaks have rules added by the Admin. Who is the Admin? It is the person responsible for the shift (or 'wardiya'). The Admin has a code to set the number of employees, and based on the number of employees, the function will determine how many employees can take the same break at the same time, so as not to affect the work, as it would not be in the company's interest if everyone took a break simultaneously.

I also want each department to have its own schedule. Meaning, the 'Chat' department has many employees and works 24 hours a day, with each employee working 8 hours. The 'SMS' department does not work 24 hours; their work is limited to two shifts starting from 9 AM to 5 PM or from 3 PM to 11 PM. The 'MNP' department starts their shifts from 8 AM to 4 PM, from 9 AM to 5 PM, and from 3 PM to 11 PM. I want there to be more than one design pattern/style. I want it to be more professional. I want it to be 100% functional. I want it to be ultra-smart."
